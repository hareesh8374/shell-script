how to install jenkins?
  to install jenkins first we need to have java in your local machine.
  use this command
  sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc]" \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
To do it automatically we can using shell script for that create a jenkins.sh file in our local machine and give the file excution permissions using chmod 700 jenkins.sh
to excute any script we use "./" or "sh" sh jenkins.sh using this command we can automatically install jenkins
after the installation of jenkins using systemctl start jenkins to start the jenkins
finally go the ec2 dashboard click on the instance where we have launched the jenkins go to security group edit inbound rules and allow 8080 port number
open a new tab ip address of the instance:8080 and enter to open jenkins in GUI on browser
the defalut path of jenkins is /var/lib/jenkins
